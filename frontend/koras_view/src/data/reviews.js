    comment: "To say this place is magical is an understatement! The photos donâ€™t really do it justice. It has a serene environment with views of the mountains and the bath was to die for looking across the bush land to the sea. The house itself is very well equipped and has a great spacious layout. Sarah and Terry were always on hand to answer questions or provide support. Definitely our best Airbnb experience to date.",

    comment: "This place is highly recommended for a family trip. Sarah and Terry are wonderful hosts. To be honest the best host was their cow Flickca. She welcomed us as soon as we arrived, and was so happy to see us each time. Loved it."
